| Overall consensus seems to be that the VI package could do with a lot of
| updating in general. There may be better options for output for VI players at
| the moment but the thought is that one day, the VI package would be updated and
| that would make whatever VI-specific output you did now broken, so I think the
| best route is to just use something like tprint, which obviously they can work
| with. And yeah, output to main window - no miniwins for VI.
| 
| Some feature requests I gathered:
| Strip punctuation, mainly the ( ). +/- needs to stay but on that note..
| Shorten level range to the average, not the whole range. So +5 instead of +3 to
| +8. Just less spammy.
| Make good/evil and levels toggles with options for display at: beginning, end,
| or totally off. I know you have the on/off right now.
| Strip other flags, except (W). Things like (T) and (I) probably aren't
| important.. but maybe make this a toggle as well?
| 
| I figure given there's only so many flags, you can capture it all with regex
| and so that should make it pretty easy to work with.
| 
| A couple other features that'd be nice:
| A consider quick option that removes mob names
| A consider super quick option that only says how many mobs in the room
| 
| Like, if you're in an area where you maybe care about align but just want to
| kill, you don't need the mobname.. or if you're in an area like ocean park then
| maybe you just care how many are in the room.
| 
| Finally not VI-related (obviously) - I'd like to have (R) and (G) give some
| highlight (i.e. different background color) in the miniwin to make it easier
| to pick out good/evil(/neutral mobs).
| 
| Areia offered to talk to you if you have some questions about VI-specific stuff
| Eroe was a little annoyed that I was acting as a middle-man but seemed willing
| to talk to you directly if you wanted to ask him. He already has his own little
| plugin and does quite a bit of coding afaik. He's a nice guy though so don't be
| afraid to reach out if you want to. Especially if you're putting in effort just
| for the sake of the VI community, I'm sure he'd be more than happy to help in
| some way.
| 
| Anyway I know you're busy so you know, prioritize your life the right way :)
| 
| Regardless, appreciate it all. You're a rock star. Thanks!
